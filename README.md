## Introduction:

Crime rate is one of our nation's most critical issues. Our study believes that statistical analysis can be used to  provide meaningful understanding of a city, state, or nation's status on crime and the various factors that impact crime. From these findings we hope to suggest actionable and effective public policies at various levels of government. 

The goal of this report is to answer the question: How do factors of the population affect crime rate? 


## Scope:

Given the data set presented, our scope to answer this question beings with providing data-driven insights into key determinants of crime in the state of North Carolina in 1987. Using statistical techniques, we will analyze the data set, discuss our assumptions, and present recommendations to form policies at the county or regional level. 

This research study utilizes data from C. Cornwell and W. Trumball (1994), “Estimating the Economic Model of Crime with Panel Data,” Review of Economics and Statistics. We are 3 linear regression models that we have built to emphasize key facets of data, and to highlight which factors have an significant effect on estimating crime rate. 


## Analysis:

Model 1 is a rudementary solution that uses explanatory variables to displays a positive correlation with crime rate. It will be discussed in greater detail below, but to preface, here we show that high population density and high tax revenue in fact are correlated with higher crime rates. 

In Model 2, a few more explanatory variables are added to diversify our model. Specifically probability of arrest and probability of convicted crime are taken into consideration and show a strong negatively linear relationship with crime rate. 

Finally in Model 3, we develop a model in a "smorgasbord" fashion. We include nearly all the explanatory variables that we have present in our data set. The goal here is to push our models boundaries with a potential overfitting of data. Though this may seem slightly excessive, we want to be able to compare this to the other models and consider statistical significance as well as practical significance on how successfully we can measure and capture the behavior of crime rate while minimizing the amount of factors we need to consider.

We want to remphasize that the variables mentioned above respective to each model will be discussed in greater detail below. Though we may not be able to generalize findings from North Carolina in 1987 to the entirity of the United States, by the end of this report we hope to explain crime rate within our scope and suggest to the local government necessary policies or decisions they can make to address issues and concerns with crime.
